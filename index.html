                <h3>Reveal Yourself, Reflection!</h3><br><br>
                <p>
                    This piece features a self-portrait of me looking at my drag persona, Sailor Claire.<br>
                    This is intended to be looked at any angle, and plays into the idea of the "reflection world."<br>
                    Basically, a world that shows us our true reflections. Sailor Claire is basically who my reflection is, <br>
                    and everyone else has their own reflection that relates to who they truly are on the inside. <br>
                    What do you think your reflection would look like?

                        Character art I made for an OokiSoraCon mascot contest.<br>
                        Just submitted it, so I hope I win! Then again, competition is always fairly tough<br>
                        and so many other pretty designs also make it through. Here's hoping for third place!!

                                Looks like some...visitor from another world.<br>
                                Doesn't look like it goes by any earthly conventions...<br>
                                So far it just watches and has an incredibly playful persona<br>
                                almost like a puppy dog. What will this...thing turn into...?

                                A piece of art I created for my Ways of Knowing Class. <br>
                                I created it in remembrance of people in my life who, for whatever reason,<br>
                                aren't really in it anymore. I see their ghosts all the time through<br>
                                people who look exactly like them, and even though it's not them<br>
                                deep down inside my heart I wish it was.<br><br>
                                I put this in a presentation and I got a B- on it. To be fair, I shouldn't<br>
                                have told the story about my old friends and the dog who would not stop<br>
                                pooping in the parking lot. I think that professor just didn't like me cause<br>
                                I caught him laughing at it, and I probably had the most class engagement<br>
                                but that's besides the point and now I'm yapping.
